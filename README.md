Git is a powerful version control system that enables developers to manage changes to their code efficiently. By tracking modifications, facilitating collaboration, and allowing for easy branching and merging, Git has become an essential tool for software development. In this exercise, we will initialize a new Git repository, create essential project files such as README.md and LICENSE.md, and develop a simple webpage detailing our team. We will learn to stage and commit changes, manage branches, resolve merge conflicts, revert commits, and use stashing to temporarily save changes. Additionally, we will clean up the repository by deleting unnecessary branches, gaining hands-on experience with Git's core functionalities.

### What We Will Do

Throughout this process, we will create and manage a Git repository step-by-step, starting with initialization and file creation. We will practice committing changes and modifying files, including simulating and resolving merge conflicts. Additionally, we will explore techniques like reverting commits and stashing changes, culminating in a thorough understanding of how to maintain a clean and organized Git repository.
